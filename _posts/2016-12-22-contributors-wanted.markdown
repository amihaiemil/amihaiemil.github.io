preview: A chance to practice pure oop while contributing to fun projects!
---

I started contributing to opensource almost a year ago while working with [Teamed.io](http://www.teamed.io/).
In the meantime I also started my own projects which are all out in the open, on [Github](https://www.github.com/amihaiemil).
Some worth mentioning are: a webcrawler, an evolutionary algorithm framework and a Github chatbot.

Now, when all of them have a pretty solid shape, I am looking for contributors.
This is not only because I don't have enough time to take care of everything, but also
because I believe if a project doesn't have more contributors, it is not known and so
it won't fly for too long (if it ever takes off, that is).

Besides the existing ones, I also have other ideas which I think would be cool to
implement. The latest one I had was an object-oriented YAML parser for Java.
There is already [one](http://jyaml.sourceforge.net/) but it's old and not maintained anymore.

Here are some details about the workflow:

* [PDD](http://www.yegor256.com/2009/03/04/pdd.html) should always be used
* DevOps routines, including merging of PRs is done by [rultor](rultor.com)
* Puzzles in the code are turned into Github Issues and eventually closed by [0pdd](http://www.0pdd.com/)
* Nothing is to be left without a unit test. e.g. If you have a task asking you to implement a method it is
understood that also at least one unit test is expected.
* Small tasks: 30min to 1h estimation. If the task is too big or defined in a very abstract manner, outline the
solution and puzzle the rest of the job out.

Key technologies: **java**, but also others are welcomed. **e.g.** I myself would like to have a chance
to learn Ruby, so if you have an idea of a cool Ruby library, we could work on it together, and you would
play the archtiect role.

This chance is for every developer that has at least a medium knowledge of OOP and wants to learn something
and exercise their knowledge **outside college or the 9-to-5 office routine**.

**Please note** that at the moment I do not earn any money from this so we're not
talking about any payments, at least for the foreseable future.

So, if you're interested in enriching your knowledge and CV drop me a line, we'll talk.
