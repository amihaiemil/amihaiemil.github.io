My name is Mihai Andronache and I am a Java developer. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
I'm contributing to opensource and writing this blog because I find it a good way of getting rid of the office job routine, learning new things and keeping my knowledge updated.

On Github, we have two organizations: [opencharles](https://github.com/opencharles) and [decorators-squad](https://github.com/decorators-squad) containing multiple projects.
Some worth mentioning are:
  * A Java OOP web crawler (see [Project Charles](http://www.amihaiemil.com/2016/12/05/project-charles.html))
  * A Github chatbot for indexing and searching gh-pages websites ([charles-rest](https://github.com/opencharles/charles-rest))
  * A Java OOP YAML parser ([camel](https://github.com/decorators-squad/camel))
  * A versioneye API OOP wrapper for Java ([versioneye-api](https://github.com/decorators-squad/versioneye-api))

More to come soon...
